      <!-- Overview -->
      <section class="about-overview">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The Blockchain Voting System leverages the power of blockchain to
          provide a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof platform for
          elections. It ensures every vote is counted and stored immutably,
          enhancing trust in the electoral process.

        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Security:</strong> Each vote is cryptographically secured
            and stored immutably.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Transparency:</strong> The blockchain allows all
            participants to verify the integrity of the election.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Immutability:</strong> Once votes are cast, they cannot be
            altered.

      <!-- How It Works -->
      <section class="about-how-it-works">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          The system enables voters to register securely, cast votes, and tally
          results using blockchain technology. Each vote is a transaction that
          is stored in a block, and all blocks are linked together in a secure
          chain.
        </p>

      <!-- Technical Foundation -->
      <section class="about-technical">
        <h2>Technical Foundation</h2>
        <p>
          This system is built on blockchain principles such as cryptographic
          hashing, decentralized ledgers, and proof-of-work for block
          validation.
